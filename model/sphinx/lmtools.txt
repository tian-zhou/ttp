1. go to   http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool.html              (click on lmtool)
2. upload a txt file, each line for a sentence all in capital (I am not sure if it's necessary to do such format..)
3. download the lm and dic files in the next page 
4. put the downloaded file in this folder
5. change the name to 1.dic and 1.lm



FIRST, CREATE A CORPUS FILE consisting of all sentences you would like the decoder to recognize. The sentences should be one to a line (but should not have punctuation symbols). You may not need to exhastively list all possible sentences: the decoder will allow fragments to recombine into new sentences; but the sentences you provide will be preferred. For example:

	THIS IS AN EXAMPLE SENTENCE
	EACH LINE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'D WANT YOUR SYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE
	ACRONYMS PRONOUNCED AS LETTERS ARE BEST ENTERED AS A T_L_A
	NUMBERS AND ABBREVIATIONS OUGHT TO BE SPELLED OUT FOR EXAMPLE
	TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE ET CETERA
	YOU CAN UPLOAD A FEW THOUSAND SENTENCES
	BUT THERE IS A LIMIT
